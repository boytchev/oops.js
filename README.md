# Only One-pass Shader (oops.js)

**Oops.js** is a library which attempts to squeeze higher performance from Three.js postprocessing effects, by:

* merging the source codes of several shaders
* embedding static uniforms as shader constants

Additionally, the library makes small adjustment to the shaders properties,
so they are not completely the same as their Three.js counterparts.
