# Only One-pass Shader (oops.js)

**Oops.js** is a library which attempts to squeeze higher
performance from Three.js postprocessing effects, by:

* baking static uniforms in the shader code,
* merging several compatible shaders into one,
* reducing the number of postprocessing passes.

At the same time the library profides a simple user-friendly
API to combine various postprocessing effects.


## Warning

Currently Oops.js is under a heavy development. It is still
not suitable for end users.
